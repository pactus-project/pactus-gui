## Widget Book
We use Widget Book for documenting and showcasing our UI components:
- [Widget Book Repository](https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus-gui-widgetbook)
- [Widget Book Live Showcase](https://pactus-project.github.io/pactus-gui-widgetbook)

The Widget Book serves as:
- A living style guide for the application
- A component library for developers
- A visual documentation of all UI elements

## Requirements
- [Flutter 3.27.3 or higher](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- [Dart 3.6.1 or higher](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- Android Studio/VSCode with Flutter plugin
  - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) (for Android builds)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS builds)

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pactus-project/pactus-gui.git
   cd pactus-gui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Build and Run
Use the build runner script to handle all build and run operations:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x build_runner.sh

# Run the script
./build_runner.sh
```

You'll be presented with two options:
1. **Automatic Execution**: Handles all build processes and runs the application
2. **Re-Generate Asset Files**: Only regenerates asset files

### Manual Commands
If you prefer to run commands manually:

```bash
# Generate localization files
flutter gen-l10n --output-dir=lib/l10n --arb-dir=lib/l10n

# Run build runner
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# Run the application
flutter run
```

| chore     | Other changes not modifying src/test files       |

#### Commit Scope
Specify which part of the code is affected (e.g., wallet, validator, ui). Multiple scopes can be used if changes impact several areas.

#### Commit Message Format
- Keep under 50 characters
- Start with lowercase letter
- No ending punctuation
- Use imperative mood (e.g., "fix bug" not "fixed bug")

Examples:
- Correct ✅: "feat(wallet): add biometric authentication"
