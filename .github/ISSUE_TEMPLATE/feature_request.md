### Scenario: Changing Your Profile

Imagine a user opens the app and wants to update their profile. They navigate to the "Profile" section, where they see their current name and picture. The user decides to change their name and upload a new profile picture. After making these changes, they tap the "Save" button.

Once they save, the app sends the updated information to the server. If everything goes well, the user will see a message saying "Profile updated!" If thereâ€™s an issue, they will see "Update failed." Finally, the user returns to their profile to see their new name and picture displayed.
