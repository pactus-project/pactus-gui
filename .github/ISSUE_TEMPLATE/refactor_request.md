## Overview
**Component/Feature:** Describe the component or feature being redesigned or refactored.  
**Reason:** Briefly explain the rationale for the redesign or refactor and why it is necessary.

## Goals
- Address specific issues with the current design or code.
- Outline key improvements aimed at enhancing user experience and/or technical performance (e.g., code readability, performance, maintainability).

## Proposed Changes
List specific changes you plan to make during the redesign or refactoring process.

## Design Reference
- **Figma Design:** [Link to Figma Design](#)  
  (Include relevant Figma design(s) that outline any changes needed to the user interface and interactions. If the Figma design has not changed, please remove this section. If the design has changed, please provide detailed references.)

- **Design Inspirations:**  
  Link to design references or mockups that illustrate the desired direction for the redesign.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  Ensure the redesign or refactor adheres to all responsive design standards. Document specific areas that require adjustments for responsiveness, ensuring that all components adapt smoothly to various screen sizes and orientations using `MediaQuery` and responsive layout techniques in Flutter.

- **Platform-Specific Implementations:**  
  Identify any components or design elements that may need unique implementations based on the operating system (e.g., Android or iOS). Include links to sections that necessitate OS-specific adaptations, such as navigation patterns or gesture controls that must align with platform guidelines. Note: Changes to platform-specific implementations may not be required for every task.

## API Integration
- **API Endpoint:**  
  Specify any API endpoint(s) that will be affected or updated due to the redesign or refactor. If no changes are needed to the API endpoints, please remove this section. If there are updates required, provide detailed information about the endpoints involved, including any request methods (GET, POST, etc.) and expected responses.

- **Data Requirements:**  
  Describe any changes to the data requirements from the API, including any new fields or structures that will be needed post-redesign/refactor. If there are no changes to the data requirements, please remove this section. If modifications are necessary, outline the expected data format, including any validation rules or constraints for new or altered fields.

## Potential Impact
- How might this affect existing functionality?
- Are there tests that need to be updated or added?
